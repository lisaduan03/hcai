Dear Claims Representatives,

Re: Appeal of Denial for CPT Code 99214 (Office/Outpatient Visit) - Claim Number 123456789

I am writing to appeal the denial of my recent claim for a follow-up office visit on October 3, 2024. I strongly disagree with the reason provided for the denial, which states that the procedure does not meet our criteria for medical necessity at this time.

After reviewing our patient's chart and considering their symptoms, including persistent lower back pain described as dull and constant radiating to the right leg, I believe that the current need for care meets the guidelines. The patient has reported difficulty sitting for long periods and standing for more than 30 minutes, which may indicate limited activity limitation.

Furthermore, our clinical documentation suggests that the patient's symptoms have not improved significantly despite physical therapy and over-the-counter pain medication (ibuprofen). This indicates a clear need for further evaluation and potential treatment options.

I would like to request an opportunity to review the decision-making process used to deny this claim. I believe that additional information or clarification on the specific guidelines used may be necessary to understand the basis for the denial.

I have attached my patient visit notes, which provide a detailed account of their symptoms, medical history, and treatment. I hope that this documentation will support our appeal.

Thank you for considering our request. Please let me know if further information or clarification is required.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
